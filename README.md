# RestaurantManagingSystemWithCpp
This is a simple Restaurant ordering system which lets you order from a list of items and calculates your total order and stores the order details and order number in text files
I had made this from scratch as mini a project for my college
It's quite basic and is a good project for someone who wants to prctice coding c++

Key features:
Previous orders can be viewed from the console application or by accessing the previous.txt file from the same folder
Contains most basic features required example: new order, add item, remove item, etc
Runs without any bugs on gcc version 8.1.0

Flaws:
New items cannot be adde to the menu without editing code
